To remove this white space, several methods can be employed:

1. Remove Whitespace in HTML: By eliminating spaces, line breaks, or tabs in the HTML between inline-block elements, you can prevent the browser from rendering whitespace. This method is straightforward but may reduce HTML readability.

2. Set Font Size to Zero: Setting the font-size of the parent container to 0 removes the whitespace. The font size for the child elements can then be reset, effectively eliminating space without altering the HTML structure.

3. Negative Margin: Applying a negative margin to the inline-block elements can overlap the whitespace. While this method provides a quick fix, it may require adjustments for proper spacing.

4. Commenting Out the Space: HTML comments can be used to eliminate space between inline-block elements. This technique maintains readability while preventing whitespace rendering.

5. Using CSS Flexbox or Grid: Switching to a CSS Flexbox or Grid layout removes the whitespace issue entirely, as these modern layout models do not experience the same whitespace rendering problem as inline-block.
