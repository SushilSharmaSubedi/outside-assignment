Identifying Block Elements and Inline Elements

#Block Elements
    Block elements are those that occupy the full width available, creating a new line before and after the element. They typically start on a new line and take up the entire width of their parent container.

Examples of Block Elements:

1. <div>: A generic container for flow content.
2. <h1> - <h6>: Headings of different levels, with <h1> being the highest level.
3. <p>: A paragraph of text.
4. <section>: A thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
5. <article>: Independent content that can be distributed and reused.
6. <nav>: A section of navigation links.
7. <header>: Introductory content or navigational links for a section or page.
8. <footer>: Footer content for a section or page.
9. <aside>: Content that is related to the main content but is separate from it (like sidebars).
9. <form>: A container for input elements.

#Inline Elements
    Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They can sit next to each other on the same line.

Examples of Inline Elements:

1. <span>: A generic inline container for text.
2. <a>: An anchor link to another webpage or resource.
3. <strong>: Represents strong importance (usually bold).
4. <em>: Represents emphasized text (usually italic).
5. <img>: Embeds an image in the document.
6. <br>: Inserts a line break.
7. <code>: Represents a fragment of computer code.
8. <small>: Renders text smaller than the surrounding text.
9. <sub>: Renders text as subscript.
10. <sup>: Renders text as superscript.
