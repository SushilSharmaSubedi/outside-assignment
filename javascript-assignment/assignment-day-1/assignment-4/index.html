      How do var, let, and const differ in terms of scope and hoisting? Write a
      code differentiating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between var, let, and const in terms of scope and hoisting
      are as follows:
    </p>
    <p>Scope:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        var is function-scoped or globally-scoped. It does not have block scope.
      </li>
      <li>
        let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within
        the block they are defined.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hoisting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized
        with undefined.
      </li>
      <li>
        let and const are hoisted to the top of their block but are not
        initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a
        ReferenceError.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Reassignment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>var can be re-assigned and re-declared.</li>
      <li>const cannot be re-assigned or re-declared.</li>
    </ul>
