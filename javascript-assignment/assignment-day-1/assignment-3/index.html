    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between function scoping and block scoping are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Function scoping uses the var keyword to declare variables, which are
        scoped to the function in which they are declared.
      </li>
      <li>
        Block scoping uses the let and const keywords to declare variables,
        which are scoped to the block in which they are declared.
      </li>
    </ul>
